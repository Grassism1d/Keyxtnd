# Keyxtnd
A custom extended keybind config for Prasanthragan's Hyprdots!
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

This is a custom keybind configiration meant for apps that arent already included in the hyprdots keybind configuration. Some apps include :

vencord, osu, video downloader, 

**Instructions:**
Simply download the config file below that has been already modifed to include your apps!

(config file coming soon)

Enter your own config file by using either nano or another text program in your code like this :
`/home/usr/.config/hypr/keybindings.conf`
(replace usr with your own user lmao)


(you can also simply direct your own files to the $<app name> by copying the file directory.)

**WARNING** this could overlay your old keybinds if they were already modifed, make sure to adjust your config kebind file first if you know any programs that have already modifed it.
